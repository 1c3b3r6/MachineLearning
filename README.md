# MachineLearning

This repository hosts the programs for various machine learning problems that I have solved.
The problem Score-Predictor was my first problem and hence I didn't use library frameworks. Instead I wrote them my self in octave. Others (and hopefully in future as well) are written in python or other higher level programming languages.
